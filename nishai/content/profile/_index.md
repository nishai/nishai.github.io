## About Me

Hi, I’m Nishai! I am 24 and I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Takealot.com. I am a Masters graduate in Computer Science at Wits University, where I am a member of the RAIL research lab.

I find it fascinating how machine learning algorithms are able to learn to do complex tasks. My research interests are in transfer learning and graph neural networks. I enjoy piecing together various machine learning methods with great tech to solve real problems. I live in Johannesburg, South Africa. 

I consider myself focused, ambitious and creative. Besides machine learning, I love listening to music, reading, brewing coffee, travelling, meeting new people and discovering new ideas.
